## Java   Anka

A java program to track Participant tasks

## Project Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder contains the java source files
- `lib`: the folder contains mysql-connector.jar

## To run the project (For linux)

``` 
    java -cp bin JavaProgram 
```
 ## For windows
 ```
 java -cp bin '--enable-preview' javaProgram 
 ```

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
